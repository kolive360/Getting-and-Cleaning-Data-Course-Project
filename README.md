# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project


In this project the concepts learned in the Getting and Cleaning Data course are applied.

These concepts are applied to a set of data obtained from:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

to be worked in RStudio V.


The files that comprise the work are:
    /nCodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
    /nrun_analysis.R    
    /nFinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
