# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

In this project the concepts learned in the Getting and Cleaning Data course are applied.
The stated purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work, and clean a dataset.

## These concepts are applied to a set of data obtained from:
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
to be worked in RStudio Version 1.2.5042

## The files that comprise the work are:
    - CodeBook.md a codebook describing the variables, data, and any transformations or the work you did to clean up the data.
    - run_analysis.R the script performs the following actions with the dataset.   
        1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
        3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
        5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
        6. Check DataSet
    - FinalDataSet.txt Tthis file contains the final database after obtaining, manipulating and cleaning the data.
